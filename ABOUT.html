    Born in Seoul, South Korea but I consider Los Angeles to now be home.
    I moved over when I was 16, it was a mess. I was lucky to be such a mess,
    I had nothing to lose so tried everything. From being a video editor,
    graphic designer to photographer, I became capable of wearing many hats.<br>
    While in South Korea I trained heavily on traditional fundementals of art and design.
    Though it was helpful, the focus on pure accuracy limited my perception of art.
    It took many years but I learned the importance of play and fun in creativity.
    In 2023 I started making cartoons about the joys, pains, and mundane of my ordinary life.
    I will forever be grateful for all the people it reached and continues to reach.<br>
